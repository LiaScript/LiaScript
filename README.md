# LiaScript

[LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io) is an extension to Markdown to support
the creation of free and open online courses, interactive books and thus, Open
Educational Resources (OER). Courses are simple text-files, that can be hosted
and created freely by everyone similar to Open-Source project. This projects
contains the just-in-time compiler that runs directly within your browser.

**Website:** https://LiaScript.github.io

**Extension:**

- Multimedia
- Quizzes
- Text2Speech
- Animations
- Surveys
- Interactive Tables
- ASCII-art
- Online Programming
- Integration of JavaScript
- Mixing HTML with Markdown
- Extendability due to Macros
- Internal event system
- Literal programming
- ...

Furthermore, this project is a
[Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)
, which means, if you open your LiaScript document at the project site at
https://LiaScript.github.io/course/ , the document gets stored on your Browser
like in your personal library. The Website can be installed locally and all
states are also stored within your system locally. Thus, you have total access
to your courses even if you are offline. And sharing a course is simply, sharing
the link to the README.md file.

## Related Projects

**Editor:** There are currently two plugins available for the GitHub-Editor
[Atom](https://atom.io), that should help to ease the writing process of
LiaScript courses.

- [liascript-preview](https://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview): Is a tiny
  previewer that, if it was toggled, updates the view on your course each time
  you save your document.

- [liascript-snippets](https://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-snippets): If you
  start typing "lia" in your document you switch on a fuzzy search, that
  contains a lot of LiaScript help, examples, and snippets.


Additionally it is also possible to use [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
as an editor for creating LiaScript online courses. The packages work similar to the
upper ones, but to enable the preview the Dev-Server is used for the previews in
[VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download):


- [liascript-preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LiaScript.liascript-preview)
- [liascript-snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LiaScript.liascript-snippets)


---

**LiaScript-DevServer:** If you your another editor you can also use this
project to run your own LiaScript server that monitors your files and performs
an update of your preview, whenever you save your files...

- Project-Sources:
  https://github.com/LiaScript/LiaScript-DevServer/

- or install directly from
  [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liascript/devserver)
  via:

  `npm install -g @liascript/devserver`

---

**CodiMD -> LiaMD:** At the
[#SemesterHack](https://hochschulforumdigitalisierung.de/de/online-hackathon)
we updated the free and open online editor for Markdown (CodiMD) to work with
LiaScript. This can now be used to setup and host your own LiaScript online
editor, and it runs also in docker.

- Project-Sources:
  https://github.com/liascript/codimd

- Result-presentation of the hackathon:
  https://semesterhack.incom.org/project/187

**LiaScript-Exporter:** Currently a command-line tool to export
LiaScript-courses to other formats. At the moment SCORM1.2 and SCORM2004 are
supported, which allow to upload a course packed as zip, into nearly every
commonly used Learning Management System (LMS). A list of supported LMS is
contained within the project description. It has been tested with
[Moodle](https://moodle.org) and [OPAL](https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal).
Additionally it is possible to export courses to the IMS-Cartridge format, PDF,
standalone web-projects and Android APKs.

GitHub: https://github.com/LiaScript/LiaScript-Exporter/

**Localization:** The project internationalization files are contained at

https://github.com/liaScript/lia-localization/locale

If you want to contribute, add a new translation file ...

## Examples

**Templates:** Since courses can make use of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ETC, and
encapsulate functionality within Macros, these Macros can be imported by other
courses. A set of importable documents is hosted at
[GitHub](https://github.com). Every document is a self-contained course
describing the usage of Macro and their implementation.

GitHub: https://github.com/topics/liascript-template

**Library:** At the moment there is a collection of some open tutorials and
complete ports of some Wikibooks (about C Programming, Lua, etc.) that are now
interactive.

## Contribute

Start writing online courses, translate your PowerPoint presentations, Word
documents, LMS courses, etc. into LiaScript Markdown and host them on
[GitHub](https://github.com), but [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) is also
okay. Make your content and notes accessible and searchable on GitHub, so that
it is not lost over time.

If you know some nice JS libraries or services, create a template course, that
can be imported into other courses, to make them even fancier. You can host them
in your own GitHub repository.

LiaScript has a set of connectors to store and retrieve data from different
"Backends". At the moment there are three versions, a basic connector, a pwa
connector that makes use of IndexedDB to store data, and a SCORM1.2 connector.
It would be great to support a wider range of systems and LMS formats (e.g.
AICC, xAPI, cMi5).

It exists an an [editor](https://github.com/liaScript/LiaScript/tree/editor)
branch, that is currently used to connect to Atom via the
[liascript-preview](https://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview) Plugin.
It would be great, to support also other editors in the future.

Add some more localization files to: https://github.com/liaScript/lia-localization

I could not compile the project so far, that it runs on Internet explorer and
other older Browsers, that are still in use. Is there is an expert on Babel and
Parcel out there, who could help?

## Preview

If you want to add a preview-link for the course to your site, simply add the
following script to the head of your website and place the custom webcomponent
`preview-lia` anyone in your document, with `src` pointing to your LiaScript
course.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <!-- add preview-lia tag support to display all course related information -->
    <script
      type="text/javascript"
      src="https://liascript.github.io/course/preview-lia.js"
    ></script>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <preview-lia
      src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md"
    ></preview-lia>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

## Badges

Simply replace `URL` at the end of the snippet below with your desired GitHub
repository (and the main README.md of your master-branch will be used) or
directly point to any Markdown-file anywhere within the web.

**Badges:**

## Build

Use the following commands to download the LiaScript source-code and to build it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liascript/liascript

cd liascript

npm i

npm run watch  # develop in watch-mode

npm run build  # build to dist
```

After your first build, you can run the following commands, this will download additional
elm-patches and apply them:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd patches

make

cd .. # go back

rm -rf elm-stuff .parcel-cache # remove all cached stuff 

npm run build # force an entire rebuild of the project 
```

This will apply the following four patches:

- elm-break-dom: allows browser extensions such as screen-readers to change the
  nodes of the app, without crashing the app

- elm-patch/url: enables the file-protocol, which is only required when building
  Desktop-apps

- elm-patch/dom: enable onclick events as well as innerHTML

- Dexie: this will allow only LiaScript to access indexedDB, which increases the
  security, by restricting the access. This way information about user states,
  visited courses, etc. cannot be leaked or spied by other JavaScript modules.

## Version-Changes

**0.10.18** (18/07/2022)

- improved Sync:
  
  - Supported backends for syncing courses can now also be used in systems
    that do not support it by default. All sync-systems are now supported in
    all cases, it might be simply disabled ...

    To enable, you can use the macro:

    `classroom: enable`
  - Add 'literal' "room-names"

    Currently a room-name and a course-URL are used to generate a unique ID
    for a room. However, the user has now also the possibility to define a
    room-name within " or '. In this case only the room-name is used as the
    ID.

  - fix(Styling): Sync now below the quiz/survey

**0.10.17** (29/06/2022)

- improved charts:

  - fix: failing first load of geoJson data
  - refactor: internal charting
  - feat: Add axis-limit definitions
    
    ``` markdown
    <!-- data-xlim="0,5" data-ylim=",20.0">
    | x | y |
    |---|---|
    | 1 | 2 |
    | 3 | 4 |
    ```


**0.10.16** (28/06/2022)

- improved surveys:

  - fixed quantitative representation for small sets
  - add tooltips to quantitative outputs
  - relaxed rules for ids ...

    ``` markdown
    Would yo please rate it?
    
        [(5 â­)] â­ â­ â­ â­ â­
        [(4 â­)] â­ â­ â­ â­
        [(3 â­)] â­ â­ â­
        [(2 â­)] â­ â­
        [(1 â­)] â­
    ```

**0.10.15** (27/06/2022)

- feat: Add `font` macro to import external fonts such as egyptian hieroglyphs
        or cuneiform:

  ``` markdown
  <!--
  author: ...
  link:   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+Egyptian+Hieroglyphs&display=swap
  font:   Noto Sans Egyptian Hieroglyphs, ...
  -->
  # Course

  > Some hieroglyphs: __ðð ð½ðð ðð²ð¯ðð´ð¾ ðð¾ðð»ð¶ð¾ ðð¶ðððð¾ ðð§ðð  ð ð¯ð__
  ```
- chore: Update parcel, ace, sass, caniuse, ...

**0.10.14** (18/06/2022)

  are allowed but not mandatory (`- [X]` vs. `-[X]`)
- improve: add < and > to escape characters

**0.10.12** (02/06/2022)

- fix: Bug in heatmap-representation of tables ...

**0.10.11** (30/05/2022)

- improve: DOM - handling

  DOM can now be set to `persistent: on` within the main-header-comment. This way
  no DOM-elements of other slides will be deleted anymore, they will only set to
  `hidden`. This way other systems, that need to manipulate the DOM, can now safely
  interact with LiaScript.

  But, when dealing with a lot of iframes, movies, simulations, etc. It is still
  wise to use the `persistent: off` mode. This way, videos and sound are closed,
  when switching the slide, otherwise they will still remain active, but hidden.

  However, by default the persistency of slides is disabled, it has to be enabled
  globally, but is can also be redefined per slide:

  ``` markdown
  <!--
  persistent: on
  -->

  # Title

  ...

  ## Sub-Section
  <!--
  persistent: off
  -->


  ## Sub-Section 2
  <!--
  persistent: true
  -->

  Switching on is not required, if it is globally activated.
  ```

  - fix: target _blank removed for internal links 

**0.10.7** (07/04/2022)

- improve: LiaScript now runs also on Feature-Phones such as Nokia with
  [KaiOS](https://www.kaiostech.com) 2.5 ... CSS has been updated, web components,
  the editor, eCharts, and classroom functionality can be used.

**0.10.6** (28/03/2022)

- feat: __Synchronization via [Edrys](https://github.com/edrys-org/edrys)__

  If a course is loaded from within Edrys via the module:

  https://github.com/edrys-org/module-liascript

  States will be automatically synced within a room between all members.


**0.10.5** (23/03/2022)

- Add two helpers:
  
  - `LIA.focusOnMain`: Prevent LiaScript from stealing the focus, when a slide
    gets loaded.
  - `LIA.scrollUpOnMain`: Prevent scrolling to top when a slide is loaded.

**0.10.4** (23/03/2022)

- Add icon resources

**0.10.1** (25/02/2022)

- Build optimizations
- improve: Security by allowing only LiaScript to access indexedDB
- feat: Add functions `LIA.gotoNext` and `LIA.gotoPrevious` for improving
  navigation with external libraries
- improve: Unordered list now match the GitHub flavoured style

**0.10.0** (17/02/2022)

- Add Classroom functionality within the share section, currently supported are

  - [BeakerBrowser](https://beakerbrowser.com)
  - [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com)
  - [GunDB](https://gun.eco)

  This will at the moment synchronize quizzes and survey, and provide an overview
  on the results/inputs to all connected users. All data is only stored/synchronized
  between the users not at the backend. And when a user leaves the room, her or she
  takes the data with them, which will result in an update overview.

- Complete rebuild of the internal messaging pipeline to a service architecture.
- Better API, all functionality is now accessible from within a global `window.LIA`
  object.
- A set of new macros, which can be used to disable setting components:

  - `@classroom: disable`
  - `@sharing: false`
  - `@translateWithGoogle: off`

  You can use words like `false`, `disabled`, `0`, `OFF` ... LiaScript will recognize
  them as negative. All other words like `wouldLoveToSeeThisFeature` are treated
  as positive. __But better stick with `false/true`, `on/of`, `disable/enable`__

- Improved CSS for printing. This allows to generate beautiful content of a slide,
  with preserved links, if media or iframes are added.


**0.9.51** (26/01/2022)

- improve: Tooltip positioning

**0.9.50** (25/01/2022)

- fix: Tooltip
  
  - tabbing on touch devices works by long press
  - tooltips is deactivated on small screens
  - improved performance on parsing & links are preserved and clickable too

**0.9.49** (24/01/2022)

- feature: Add tooltips to links, which work by hovering or by putting the
  focus onto a link. This feature has to be activated within the settings,
  since it creates additional http traffic. Currently supported types of
  links:

  - Links to LiaScript courses, which have to contain the URL of the
    Markdown file
  - Links to services that support oEmbend
  - Other sites with meta information as OpenGraph, TwitterCards, otherwise
    the first image, header, and paragraphs are grabbed to create the tooltip

**0.9.47** (14/01/2022)

- improve: Video resources via Multimedia links

  - Add support for the TU Bergakademie Freiberg video platform 
    
    https://video.tu-freiberg.de

    Links like for YouTube can simply be copied into the URL part of a link and
    it will be automatically inserted as an responsive video:

    `!?[video](https://video.tu-freiberg.de/video/Zahlensysteme/e54f8df0ac5d94701b277f9bc63863f6)`

  - fix: Videos on subsequent sites with an equal structure have not been
    updated properly

**0.9.46** (09/01/2022)

- improve: Repository information

  - only visible for resources from GitHub, GitLab, DropBox
  - additional `@repository: url` macro-def, which overwrites the definitions
    from above and is also visible for exports

**0.9.45** (06/01/2022)

- improve(Links): Links to external sites do now contain a `target="_blank"` by
  default. Thus, clicks open a new tab instead of destroying the current state
  of the window.

**0.9.44** (06/01/2022)

- fix(patches): `make all` now runs all patches including the virtual-dom patch
- improve: ResponsiveVoice information is only visible if and only if text to
  speech is activated and used
- improve: A repository link is added to the information section, which points
  to the github, gitlab, or dropbox-repository. Others are about to come...

**0.9.43** (14/12/2021)

- improve: Reference macros can now also have an optional title field, which
  will be ignored during the injection. However, this might be useful for
  adding information about the content of the data:

  ```markdown
  @[Macro.Name](URL "some more information")
  ```

**0.9.42** (12/12/2021)

- fix: Indentation for bigger macro-blocks are now injected appropriately

  - fixes for generic quizzes

**0.9.39** (04/10/2021)

* improve: Attached scripts are now executed only if a change was triggered by the
  user and their default value gets loaded. The default or initial state for quizzes
  and surveys is undefined, for tasks it is defined by the initial state.
* improve: Add `send.clear` command to scripts

**0.9.37** (01/10/2021)

* hotfix: modal script-editor now prohibits translations

**0.9.36** (01/10/2021)

* Attached scripts can now also publish their results

**0.9.24** (30/07/2021)

- Add arabic translation: `language: ar`
- Improved inline parsing speed.
- Add support for sharing courses on other protocols than `http://` and
  `https://`.
  
  - [`hyper:// & dat://`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dat_%28software%29)

    This allows to use the
    [Beaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_%28eb_browser%29) browser
    for creating, sharing, and editing courses directly within the browser,
    _no further upload required!_ 

  - [`ipfs:// & ipns://`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System)

    Since the newest version of the [Brave](https://brave.com) browser also has
    support for the "InterPlanetary File-System".

    [Blog-Post](https://brave.com/brave-integrates-ipfs)

  - How is this achieved?

    Actually by applying a patch to the original elm-url module, which can be
    found here:

    https://github.com/andre-dietrich/elm-patch

- Minor fixes in pre-processing, spelling , styling, and removed
  line-highlighting for not interactive code-blocks

- Additional headers are allowed, if they are within lists or block-quotes,
  etc.:

  ``` markdown
  # Outer Header

  > ## Inner Header
  >
  > which will not lead to a separate slide.
  ```

**0.9.23** (12/07/2021)

  additionally these embeds can be used in galleries as well.
- fix(ASCII-art): wrong concatenation of multi verbatim elements in single-line

**0.9.16** (17/05/2021)

- hotfix: Google finds always ways to trick me, this time it was with
  translating of long paragraphs, which worked sometimes. Now sentences
