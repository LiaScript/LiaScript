{-| The evaluation of code from code-snippets is passed back as `Eval`:

    -- everything went fine
    { ok = True
    , result = "42" -- the result is always a string
    , details = [] -- the details are directly passed to the ACE editor instance
    }

    -- an error has occurred
    { ok = False

        text = "some error message or warning" ,
        type = "error|warning|info",
        }],
        []]
    }

The `details` entry contains a list of list of dicts. This way multiple warnings
or information can be associated to one file within a project in a code-snippet.
Thus, the very first list in details is associated with the first file in a
project, etc.

{-| Replace all appearances of the `@input` macro within the code, which is
thought to represent the default input.

This should be done as the last step, after all instances of parameterized
`@input` have been replaced:

{-| When dealing with projects in LiaScript, then these projects can contain
multiple files, which shall be injected into the code, send to the execution.
The position is marked as a `@input(id)`, where id is a number ranging from
0 to 9.

inject results from other scripts that have a topic on which they publish
their results:

  - `scripts`: is a keyed list of results from other scripts, where the first
    parameter defines the topic and the second one the replacement string
  - `inputs`: mostly contains all files from a LiaScript code-snippet project,
    which is used to replace numbered input macros => `@input(id)`
