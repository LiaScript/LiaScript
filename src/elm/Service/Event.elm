{-| An `Event` can be used to communicate via ports between Typescript and Elm.

  - The **`reply`** field is used to indicate if the `track` should be recorded.
    By default it is set to `True`, but you can use the function `withNoReply`
    to set this to `False`. This way, as Typescript service will not send a
    reply back.

  - A **`track`** is basically a way of communication from Typescript to Elm.
    Whenever an event is routed through the elm-infrastructure, via the update
    functions to the Main port to be send outside, this is used to attach
    points (POIs) like:

        ("section", Just 3) :: ("quiz", Just 12) :: ...

    When an answer is send back to elm, this trail is used to identify the
    appropriate receiver.

  - **`service`** on the other side is used to identify the recipient of the
    event on the Typescript side. It can be a string like `"TTS"`.

  - The **`message`** contains a record with a command as a simple string, while
    param is used to deliver the appropriate ... PARAMETERS. These can be
    arbitrary values, therefor it requires custom decoders on the elm-side.

    Use the function empty to initialize an event with an empty (null)
    parameter set.

    , service : String
    , message :
        { cmd : String
        , param : JE.Value
        }
    }


{-| A `POI` in this case is only a tuple of a string, which defines where
an event comes from. The usage of the additional `Int` parameter is mostly
used, if there is an array involved. For example by using quizzes, the
additional number is used to identify the quiz on vector position 12.
A default value is -1, which in turn will also result as `Nothing`, if an
Array is queried ...

    ( "quiz", 12 )

type alias POI =
    ( String, Int )


{-| Create an event for a specific `service` and `command`, the `param` will
be set to `null`.

    empty "TTS" "cancel"

           , track = []
           , service = "TTS"

empty service command =
    init service { cmd = command, param = JE.null }


{-| Similar to `Cmd.none` these empty events are ignored when submitted.
A Event is called none, when it has not associated to a "service".
This comes handy when dealing with conditions:

    if True then
        init "TTS" "cancel"

    else
        none

-}

{-| Initialize a new event, a reply is awaited by default.

    init "ServiceID" { cmd = "name", param = JE.int 1 }

An event without response is generated via:

    { cmd = "name", param = JE.int 1 }
        |> init "ServiceID"
        |> withNoReply

-}
init : String -> { cmd : String, param : JE.Value } -> Event
init =
    Event True []


{-| This is a simplified event initialization to be used in pipes

    initGeneric "ServiceID" False "cmd" JE.null
        == ({ cmd = "cmd", param = JE.null }
                |> init "ServiceID"

           )

-}
initGeneric : String -> Bool -> String -> JE.Value -> Event
initGeneric service doReply cmd param =
    Event doReply [] service { cmd = cmd, param = param }


{-| Simply set the default `reply` value to `False`, which will result in an
event to which no response message will be send from Typescript.

    { to | track = ( po, -1 ) :: to.track }


{-| Add a `POI` to the `track`, which consists of a string and an additional
integer value.
-}
pushWithId : String -> Int -> Event -> Event
pushWithId po i to =
    { to | track = ( po, i ) :: to.track }


{-| Pop the latest point from the event track, while ignoring the integer
value.

        _ ->
            ( Nothing, event )


{-| Similar to `pop`, but both `POI` values as well as the new event with the
shorter event track will be returned, if there is an POI within the `track`.
-}
popWithId : Event -> Maybe ( String, Int, Event )
popWithId event =
    case event.track of
        ( po, i ) :: track ->

            Nothing


{-| Get the entire `POI` only.
-}
poi : Event -> Maybe ( String, Int )
poi =
    .track >> List.head


{-| Return only the string part of the `POI`, but do not change the event track.
-}
topic : Event -> Maybe String

{-| Return only the integer part of the `POI`, but do not change the event track.

{-| This can be used at the final decoding step of the event, if only the:

    destructure event
        == ( Just "topic", 12, ( "stop", JE.null ) )

    destructure event2
        == ( Nothing, -1, ( "stop", JE.null ) )

final values are required to react onto a message.

{-| Return the message as a tuple of the string cmd and a json value, which
needs to be decoded. This comes handy within `case ... of` statements.
