{-| The `Context` defines the current state of the parser. It keeps track of the
current indentation as well as on all identified elements that might require state
control:

  - `indentation`: a list of `["  ", "> "]`, elements are pushed on and popped
    off this stack, to check the currently defined indentation.
  - `indentation_skip`: defines if the indentation should be skipped within the
    next step
  - `****_vector`: any kind of state to preserve for the applied sub-modules.
    Normally new states are pushed on this stack/array and their position (id) is
    later used to identify the required element from within the views.
  - `effect_model` & `effect_number` are specific, the `effect_number` is a
    stack of Int that is required to keep the current animation-id, if for
    example `<script>` are used within a effect or to deal with nested effects.
  - `defines`: is a set of macros and other definitions, that are normally
    defined within the head of every LiaScript document
  - `footnotes`
  - `defines_updated`:
  - `search_index`: a function, that translates a string title into a section
    number

> Context is commonly used per section, since sections are pre-parsed at first
> and afterwards only the current section is parsed, in order to speed up
> execution.
