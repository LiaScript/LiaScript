{-| This is a basic container module for dealing with synchronized data. At
this moment it is a weak type of a CRDT, since it uses `Dict`s as a
replacement for `Set`s. Thus, keys are used to store the ids of remote peers.
If there is a conflict for some reason within the associated value, this is
at the moment ignored, entries will get merged and state simply ignored.

This local version of a `Container` is thought to be used for storing
replicated states locally or in other words per section.

**Why per `Section` and not as part of the sharable element itself?**

The reason for this is, that in order to perform synchronization, where
by different users different slides have been visited, the state has to
be stored outside of the elements, which at the point in time of the
synchronization might not exist for all peers.


## Data

@Container


## Convenience functions

@init ,@isEmpty, @empty, @get, @union, @union\_


## JSON

@encode, @decode, @decoder

{-| Used to initialize an entire Vector-state such as for Quizzes. The `id` to
be passed is the peer itself. The

Parameters:

  - `id`: Own peer-ID
  - `map`: A functions that translates the current state into a sharable state,
    not everything
  - `array`: The additional array defines the original state used within the
    quiz, survey, etc.
