{-| This `Container` type type is meant to be used for global synchronizations,
which can be used during the joining-phase. Thus, the entire state `Local` of
all `Sections` for quizzes, surveys, etc. can be converted to this type and
send to all peers.

As for `Local.Container` this is used as a state-based CRDT, which means that
the entire state is send to all peers.


## Data

@Container


## Convenience

@union


## JSON

{-| This is an `Array` of Local.Containers. It might be the case, that there
are no `Local.Container`s at the moment for certain `Section`s, since their
state is only restored/created when the `Section` was visited by the user.
That is why, they are represented as `Maybe`.

{-| Perform a merge between two global `Container`s (CRDT). At the moment the
first (internal) container is preferred. Thus, if there is a conflict between
the two `Container`s the external ones are ignored. The first boolean value
within the result tuple defines whether the resulting `Container` contains
updates that should be send to all peers.

{-| Convert a global `Container` into a JSON value. Since it is assumed, that
these are are rather sparse vectors, that is why not the entire `Container`
is translated into an JSON, but only a `dict` of values, where the `key`
represents the position within the `Array`.

    encode fn container =
        {"1": ..., "33": ..., "5": ...}

An additional encoder has to be passed, which defines how the custom `sync`
values have to be encoded.

{-| Decode a JSON value into an "global" `Container`, which is an `Array` of
`Local.Container`. Since the `encode` function performs a sparse encoding,
which only transmits valid states as a `Dict`. The resulting `Container`
might be shorter than the internally used state-vector. However, the `union`
function takes care of this.
